*The project aims to create a user-friendly website tailored for athletes seeking sports products, prioritizing easy navigation, personalized suggestions, and dynamic visuals reflecting athleticism. Key features include a smooth checkout process, customer reviews, and mobile optimization, ensuring accessibility across devices. The framework utilized comprises Figma, GitHub, Fork, Docker, MySQL, and AWS. EJS serves as the template instead of HTML, simplifying partial creation. The database houses clothing, equipment, and user information, enabling seamless registration and login processes. Differentiating between user and admin access, the website presents a front-end product page for users and a back-end interface for admins to manage stock and orders. Code responsiveness ensures adaptability for both desktop and mobile views.*
